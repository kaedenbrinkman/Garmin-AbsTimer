## Instructions
-	Usage varies by watch model. On Forerunner 245, press START as if you were going to start an activity. There should be a new activity option called “AbsTimer.” Select it.
-	The app will show Five Minute Abs. Press the START button to start or pause the routine. Press the MENU button (UP button on the 245, BACK button on the Venu, etc.) to change the routine. Press the DOWN button to skip to the next activity.
- It displays the current activity, along with the number of seconds until it is time to switch. After each activity is done, the watch will sound a tone and/or vibrate (depending on watch hardware) - these can be changed in the app settings in the Garmin Connect or Connect IQ app. When it reaches the end, the display will read “Complete!”
-	If you select a new type of abs, the timer will reset. AbsTimer should remember what abs you did last and display that automatically when you open the application in the future.

## Installation
Download it from the [Garmin Connect IQ app store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/851d7855-fcfe-45c6-86bb-a9488398ffdf).


## Compatibility
Right now, the app is compatible with most of the modern Garmin watches. If you have an older watch like the Forerunner 235, it is currently not compatible. Although, you can manually install [release 1.0.0](https://github.com/kaedenbrinkman/Garmin-AbsTimer/releases/tag/v1) by copying the respective .prg file into the /APPS folder on your device via USB, and you should be able to use it.
